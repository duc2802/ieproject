<abstract> ABSTRACT +L+

Many operating systems have long had pseudo-teletypes, inter-process +L+

communication channels that provide terminal semantics on one end, +L+

and a smart server program on the other. We describe an analogous +L+

concept, pseudo-network drivers. One end of the driver appears to be +L+

a real network device, with the appropriate interface and semantics; +L+

data written to it goes to a program, however, rather than to a physical +L+

medium. Using this and some auxiliary mechanisms, we present a +L+

variety of applications, including system test, network monitoring, +L+

dial-up TCP/IP, and ways to both improve and subvert network +L+

security. Most notably, we show how pseudo-network devices can be +L+

used to create virtual networks and to provide encrypted +L+

communications capability. We describe two implementations, one +L+

using a conventional driver for socket-based systems, and one using +L+

stream pipes for System V. +L+ </abstract>

This paper presents a new approach to implement fast barrier synchronization in wormhole k-ary +L+

n-cubes. The novelty lies in using multidestination +L+

messages instead of the traditional single destination +L+

messages. Two different multidestination worm types, +L+

gather and broadcasting, are introduced to implement +L+

the report and wake-up phases of barrier synchronization, respectively. Algorithms for complete and arbitrary set barrier synchronization are presented using +L+

these new worms. It is shown that complete barrier +L+

synchronization in a k-ary n-cube system with e-cube +L+

routing can be implemented with 2n communication +L+

start-ups as compared to 2n log 2 k start-ups needed +L+

with unicast-based message passing. For arbitrary set +L+

barrier, an interesting trend is observed where the synchronization cost keeps on reducing beyond a certain +L+

number of participating nodes. +L+ </abstract>

<title> A Trip-based Multicasting Model in +L+

Wormhole-routed Networks with Virtual Channels +L+ </title>

<abstract> Abstract| This paper focuses on efficient multicasting in +L+

wormhole-routed networks. A trip-based model is proposed +L+

to support adaptive, distributed, and deadlock-free multiple +L+

multicast on any network with arbitrary topology using at +L+

most two virtual channels per physical channel. This model +L+

significantly generalizes the path-based model proposed earlier [21], [22], which works only for Hamiltonian networks +L+

and can not be applicable to networks with arbitrary topology resulted due to system faults. Fundamentals of the trip-based model, including the necessary and sufficient condition to be deadlock-free, and the use of appropriate number +L+

of virtual channels to avoid deadlock are investigated. The +L+

potential of this model is illustrated by applying it to hyper-cubes with faulty nodes. Simulation results indicate that the +L+

proposed model can implement multiple multicast on faulty +L+

hypercubes with negligible performance degradation. +L+ </abstract>
